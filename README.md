your guessing-word are in your opponent's word, and number of bulls tells you how many of cows-letters are in the correct position
for instance if your oponent's word is "przychodnia" and your guessing word is "przyszłość" you got 4 bulls for "p,r,z,y" and 5 cows 
for "p,r,z,y,o" letters. The game ends if somebody guess the rival's word.
